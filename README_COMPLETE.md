                   for j in range(self.grid_size) 
                   if (i, j) not in [(0,0), (grid_size-1, grid_size-1)]]
random_walls = random.sample(available_cells, k=wall_count)
```

### Algorithm Implementations

**Q-Learning** (off-policy, model-free):
```python
Q[s, a] = Q[s, a] + α(r + γ*max(Q[s', :]) - Q[s, a])
```
- Uses max future value
- Best for learning optimal policy
- Most stable convergence

**SARSA** (on-policy, model-free):
```python
next_action = epsilon_greedy(Q[s', :])
Q[s, a] = Q[s, a] + α(r + γ*Q[s', next_action] - Q[s, a])
```
- Uses actual next action (epsilon-greedy)
- Conservative, avoids risky actions
- Slower but safer convergence

**Expected SARSA** (off-policy, model-free):
```python
expected_value = sum(policy(a|s') * Q[s', a])
Q[s, a] = Q[s, a] + α(r + γ*expected_value - Q[s, a])
```
- Expected value of next state
- Combines Q-Learning and SARSA
- Balanced approach

**Double Q-Learning** (off-policy, model-free):
```python
Q1[s, a] = Q1[s, a] + α(r + γ*Q2[s, argmax(Q1[s', :])] - Q1[s, a])
Q2[s, a] = Q2[s, a] + α(r + γ*Q1[s, argmax(Q2[s', :])] - Q2[s, a])
```
- Uses two Q-tables
- Reduces overestimation bias
- More stable long-term learning

## Results & Graphs

### Understanding the 4-Panel Output

#### Panel 1: Reward Progression
```
Shows: Blue line (raw rewards) + Orange line (moving average)
What it means:
  - Upward trend = Learning improvement
  - Smooth orange line = Convergence
  - Flat line = Policy optimization complete
Analysis:
  - Steep rises = Breakthrough moments
  - Plateaus = Algorithm saturating
```

#### Panel 2: Exploration Rate Decay
```
Shows: Red line (epsilon value per episode)
What it means:
  - High start (1.0) = Random exploration
  - Smooth decay = Gradual exploitation shift
  - Low end (0.1) = Mostly using learned policy
Analysis:
  - Steep curve = Fast exploitation shift
  - Shallow curve = Prolonged exploration
```

#### Panel 3: Episode Length
```
Shows: Green bars (steps per episode)
What it means:
  - Short bars early = Random actions, quick end
  - Longer bars mid-training = Exploration phase
  - Stabilized length = Learned consistent policy
Analysis:
  - Decreasing trend = Learning efficient paths
  - Increasing then decreasing = Exploration then optimization
```

#### Panel 4: Cumulative Reward
```
Shows: Purple line with fill (total reward accumulated)
What it means:
  - Steep rise = Rapid learning
  - Consistent slope = Stable performance
  - Plateaus = Training completion
Analysis:
  - Concave up = Accelerating improvement
  - Linear = Steady learning rate
  - Flat = Convergence or failure
```

### Example Results

**Q-Learning on 5×5 Grid (500 episodes)**:
```json
{
  "final_reward": 87.5,
  "average_reward": 42.3,
  "max_reward": 100.0,
  "min_reward": -50.0,
  "convergence_episode": 420,
  "total_steps": 7700
}
```

**Interpretation**:
- Agent achieved near-optimal final reward (87.5/100)
- Average across all episodes: 42.3
- Learned efficient path by episode 420
- Total 7700 steps for 500 episodes = 15.4 avg steps/episode

### Exporting Results for Analysis

**Python Analysis Script**:
```python
import json
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
with open('results/data/Q_LEARNING_5x5_20241022_143025.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Extract arrays
rewards = data['episode_data']['rewards']
epsilons = data['episode_data']['epsilons']
steps = data['episode_data']['steps']

# Custom analysis
print(f"Final Reward: {rewards[-1]:.2f}")
print(f"Average Reward: {sum(rewards)/len(rewards):.2f}")
print(f"Improvement: {(rewards[-1] - rewards[0]):.2f}")

# Create custom plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))

```

### Issue: Graphs not generating

**Symptom**: Training completes but no PNG/JSON files

**Causes & Solutions**:

1. **Check write permissions**:
   ```bash
   # Verify directory exists and is writable
   ls -la results/
   ```

2. **Check matplotlib backend**:
   ```bash
   python -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.get_backend())"
   ```

3. **Manual directory creation**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p results/graphs results/data
   ```

4. **Check console errors**: Look for error messages in terminal

### Issue: Slow performance

**Symptom**: GUI freezes during training

**Causes & Solutions**:

1. **Reduce grid size**:
   - Use 5×5 instead of 10×10
   - Smaller state space = faster training

2. **Reduce experience replay batch size**:
   - Disable experience replay for faster training
   - Or use batch size of 16

3. **Run on faster machine**:
   - Code is optimized, hardware limitation
   - 5×5 grid typically runs in 30-60 seconds

### Issue: Results appear incorrect

**Symptom**: Graphs show flat lines or unexpected patterns

**Solutions**:

1. **Check hyperparameters**:
   - Learning rate too low? Try 0.1-0.2
   - Initial epsilon? Should be around 0.9

2. **Check grid setup**:
   - Ensure goal is reachable
   - Verify walls don't block all paths

3. **Run longer training**:
   - 500 episodes minimum
   - 1000+ episodes for convergence

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `IndexError: list index out of range` | Grid size too small | Use grid 5×5 or larger |
| `ZeroDivisionError` | Division by metrics | Check training completed |
| `Permission denied` | Cannot write results | Create results/ directory |
| `KeyError: Q[state, action]` | Invalid state/action | Check environment setup |

## Contributing & Customization

### Adding a New Algorithm

**Template**:
```python
def update_q_value_custom(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
    """Implement custom algorithm update"""
    
    # Get current Q-value
    current_q = self.Q.get((state, action), 0)
    
    # Calculate target (algorithm-specific)
    target = reward  # Update this based on algorithm
    if not done:
        # Add future value component
        next_actions = [self.Q.get((next_state, a), 0) 
                       for a in self.actions]
        target += self.gamma * max(next_actions)
    
    # Update Q-value
    new_q = current_q + self.alpha * (target - current_q)
    self.Q[(state, action)] = new_q
```

### Custom Analysis Scripts

```python
from itertools import product
import json

alphas = [0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2]
gammas = [0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99]

results = {}
for alpha, gamma in product(alphas, gammas):
    # Train with these parameters
    # Record final reward
    results[f"α={alpha}, γ={gamma}"] = final_reward

# Find best
best = max(results.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
print(f"Best: {best[0]} with reward {best[1]}")
```

## FAQ

**Q: What's the difference between Q-Learning and SARSA?**
A: Q-Learning is off-policy (learns optimal policy), SARSA is on-policy (learns actual behavior policy). Q-Learning is usually faster, SARSA is more conservative.

**Q: Can I train on a 20×20 grid?**
A: Yes, but it will take longer (~5-10 minutes). Start with 5×5 for quick testing.

**Q: How many episodes do I need?**
A: 500 episodes is good for learning. For convergence analysis, use 1000+.

**Q: What do I do if results don't look right?**
A: Check that your goal state is reachable, try increasing learning rate, run for more episodes.

**Q: Can I use this for production ML?**
A: This is primarily educational. For production, use frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch with DQN or PPO.

**Q: How do I compare two algorithms?**
A: Train each with same settings, open both PNG files side-by-side, compare reward curves.
