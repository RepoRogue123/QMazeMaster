## 🔧 COMMON TASKS

### Run simulator
```bash
python dc.py
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

### View training graph
```bash
# PNG opens automatically after training
# Or browse to: results/graphs/
```

### Analyze training data
```bash
# Open JSON file: results/data/[name].json
# Or write Python analysis script
```

### Compare algorithms
```bash
# Train each with same settings
# Compare PNG files side-by-side
```

### Troubleshoot issues
```bash
# See README_COMPLETE.md → Troubleshooting section
```

## 📊 WHAT YOU GET AFTER TRAINING

### PNG Graph (4 panels)
- Reward progression
- Exploration rate decay
- Episode length evolution
- Cumulative reward

### JSON Data
- All hyperparameters
- Summary statistics
- Episode-by-episode arrays
- Training metadata

---

## 🎯 MAIN FEATURES

✅ Variable grid sizes (3×3 to 20×20)
✅ Real-time GUI with statistics
✅ Automatic graph generation
✅ JSON data export
✅ Experience replay system
✅ Performance monitoring
✅ Convergence detection

---

## 🔍 ALGORITHMS AT A GLANCE

| Algorithm | Best For | Speed | Stability |
|-----------|----------|-------|-----------|
| Q-Learning | Learning optimal policy | Fast | Good |
| SARSA | Risk-averse learning | Slow | Best |
| Expected SARSA | Balanced approach | Medium | Very Good |
| Double Q-Learning | Reducing overestimation | Fast | Excellent |

---

## 💡 QUICK EXPERIMENTS

### Experiment 1: Compare Algorithms
Train all 4 algorithms on 5×5 grid, compare graphs

### Experiment 2: Test Grid Sizes
Train on grids 3×3, 5×5, 10×10, compare convergence

### Experiment 3: Tune Learning Rate
Train with different α values, find optimal

### Experiment 4: Experience Replay Impact
Train with and without replay, compare

## ⚠️ COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "No module named matplotlib" | `pip install matplotlib` |
| GUI doesn't open | Check Tkinter: `pip install tk` |
| Graphs not saving | Check write permissions: `mkdir results/graphs` |
| Slow performance | Use smaller grid (5×5 instead of 10×10) |
| Results look wrong | Try longer training (1000+ episodes) |
