## 🔬 Algorithms

### Comparison Table

| Algorithm | Type | Best For | Convergence | Stability |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Q-Learning** | Off-policy | Learning optimal policy | Fast | Good |
| **SARSA** | On-policy | Risk-averse scenarios | Slower | Best |
| **Expected SARSA** | Off-policy | Balanced approach | Medium | Very Good |
| **Double Q-Learning** | Off-policy | Large state spaces | Fast | Excellent |

### Implementation Details

**Q-Learning** (Most Common):
```
Q[s, a] = Q[s, a] + α(r + γ*max(Q[s', :]) - Q[s, a])
```
Best for learning the optimal policy. Fast convergence, may overestimate values.

**SARSA** (Most Conservative):
```
Q[s, a] = Q[s, a] + α(r + γ*Q[s', a'] - Q[s, a])
```
Uses actual next action. Safer, no overestimation, slower convergence.

**Expected SARSA** (Balanced):
```
Q[s, a] = Q[s, a] + α(r + γ*E[Q[s', :]] - Q[s, a])
```
Expected value approach. Combines benefits of Q-Learning and SARSA.

**Double Q-Learning** (Advanced):
```
Uses two Q-tables to reduce overestimation bias
```
Most stable for complex environments.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No module named matplotlib"**
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

**GUI doesn't open**
```bash
pip install tk
```

**Graphs not saving**
```bash
mkdir -p results/graphs results/data
chmod 755 results/graphs results/data
```

**Slow performance**
- Use smaller grid (5×5 instead of 10×10)
- Disable experience replay
- Reduce episode count

See README_COMPLETE.md → Troubleshooting for more solutions.
